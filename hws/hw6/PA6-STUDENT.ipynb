    "#### Euclidean distance of two vectors\n",
    "The distance of two vectors, x and y, each of which are of dimension d is given by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_d(A,B) = \\sqrt{\\sum_i^d (a_i - b_i)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula can be easily computed in Python np.linalg.norm function described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Useful Linear Algebra functions in Python:\n",
    "1. array.shape() - returns a tuple containing the shape of \"array\"\n",
    "2. array.T - returns the transpose of \"array\" (i.e if \"array\" is a P x Q matrix, the transpose would be a Q x P matrix where A[i,j] = A[j,i] for all $1 \\leq i \\leq P$ and for all $1 \\leq j \\leq Q$)\n",
    "3. np.linalg.norm(array) - computes the l2 norm of \"array\" by default. Documentation can be found <a href = \"https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html\" title=\"here\"> here </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this assignment, you are given a data set in the form of a $n \\times d$ matrix, where $n$ represents the number of data points, and $d$ represents the dimensions of each data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with reducing the dimensionality of the data set using the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma and to measure the average distortion accross different projection dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are given n points where each point, $x_i$ where $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ is a massive vector in the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$ (i.e. each point is a massive vector with d elements). We are interested in all-pairwise Euclidean distances. Being able to work with vectors in lower dimensions would mean less computation, and therefore overall faster execution. \n",
    "\n", 
    "The question becomes: how do we reduce \"d\" while still maintaining a good approximation between all pairs of Euclidean distances? The answer was given by Johnson and Lidenstrauss in the form of the following lemme we saw in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Johnson Lidenstrauss lemma\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\epsilon \\in (0, \\frac{1}{2})$, Then for **any** set of points $S = \\{x_1, ..., x_n\\}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists a mapping, $A: \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^k$ where $k = O(\\frac{log n}{\\epsilon^2})$ s.t.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\forall x_1, x_2 \\in S: (1-\\epsilon)   \\| x_1 - x_2 \\|  \\leq \\|Ax_1 - Ax_2\\| \\leq (1+\\epsilon)   \\|x_1 - x_2 \\| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice in the lemma above that $k$ does not actually depend on $d$, but only on $n$ and $\\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The transformation mapping, A\n",
    "\n",
    "In class you saw that the entries of matrix $A$ are drawn from a Normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, and then this matrix is multiplied by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt k}$. An alternative construction that is suprisingly simple due to Achlioptas is the following: the mapping, A, is a $k \\times d$ matrix, where each entry in the matrix is randomly assigned as $-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt k}$ or $+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt k}$ with equal probability. The JL lemma still holds. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Distortion\n",
    "\n",
    "In many practical scenarios, we want to try dimensions $k$ less than the value required by the JL lemma. We are no longer guaranteed that $\\frac{\\|Ax_1 - Ax_2\\| }{\\sqrt{k}}$ will be within a $(1\\pm \\epsilon)$ factor of the true distance between $x_1,x_2$.  We refer to the differences in distance between transformed points and their respective original points as **distortion**. Specifically, we have the following definition of the **distortion** caused by the embedding, A:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$distortion_A(x,y) = | \\frac{\\|Ax - Ay\\|}{\\|x-y\\|} - 1|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$distortion(A) = \\max_{x,y} \\ distortion_A(x,y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\mathcal{D}$ is our dataset.   The first formula describes the distortion between a given pair of points, cause by the projection A.  The second formula defines the distortion of the mapping, A over the whole set of points in $\\mathcal{D}$, and is just the maximum distortion of any two points from  $\\mathcal{D}$"

In this problem we will be looking at a classification algorithm that uses pair wise distances to decide what class a point belongs to; the classification algorithm we will be analyzing is the KNN classifier. \n",
